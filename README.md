> Scala began life in 2003, created by Martin Odersky and his research group at EPFL, next to Lake Geneva and the Alps, in Lausanne, Switzerland. Scala has since grown into a mature open source programming langauge, used by hundreds and thousands of developers, and is developed and maintained by scores of people all over the world.

> Generic Java 개발하던 시기(아마 1999년?)의 귀여웠던 Martin Odersky. 내년(2017)에는 한국 나이로 60이 되신다. 
> 우리도 교수님을 본받아 나이들어도 멋진 개발자가 됩시다!
