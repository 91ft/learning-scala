> Scala began life in 2003, created by Martin Odersky and his research group at EPFL, next to Lake Geneva and the Alps, in Lausanne, Switzerland. Scala has since grown into a mature open source programming langauge, used by hundreds and thousands of developers, and is developed and maintained by scores of people all over the world.
